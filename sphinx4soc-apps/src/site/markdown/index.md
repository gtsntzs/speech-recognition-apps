## General

Every project has its own documentation site. In Maven projects, every Aggregator module summarizes the purpose with some general ideas of the ones to follow. For every Parent module there will be reports about its dependencies, licence, build plugins and a small summary of its child modules. Lastly every example module will have reports on every aspect of its nature and a detailed blog entry providing necessary explanations when needed.
